    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>Q: Is there a textbook for this course?</h3>
    <p>A: No</p>
    <h3>Q: Are there teaching assistants (TAs) for this course?</h3>
    <p>A: No</p>
    <h3>Q: What are the differences between the online version and the classroom version of this course?</h3>
    <p>A: The only differences between the two versions are (1) the Capture The Flags game is played in teams in the
        classroom version of the course while it is played individually in the online version, and (2) one additional
        lab in the online course. Everything else is the same: content, labs, assessment, etc.</p>
    <h3>Q: What is the workload of this course?</h3>
    <p>A: Here is a list of all the labs with expected length and difficulty:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lab 1: Working with the Command Line, Short (1 hour max) to Long (3+ hours) --you can put in as much
            time as
            you want on this lab</li>
        <li>Lab 2: Packet Sleuth, Medium (1 - 3 hours)</li>
        <li>Lab 3: Scanning and Reconnaissance, Very short (30 minutes). <strong>NOTE: This lab cannot be made
                publicly
                available because an actual target is used.</strong></li>
        <li>Lab 4: Python and the Incident Alarm, Long (over 3 hours) to Impossible</li>
        <li>Lab 5: The Password Cracking Contest, If you crack all the password hashes (read: good luck with that),
            you
            will receive an automatic "A" in the course</li>
        <li>Lab 6: The XSS Game, Medium</li>
        <li>Lab 7: Gain Access to Website, Very short. <strong>NOTE: This lab cannot be made publicly available
                because
                an actual target is used.</strong></li>
        <li>Lab 8: The Fuzzer, Short to Medium</li>
        <li>Lab 9: The CTF Game, One week individually. <strong>NOTE: This lab cannot be made publicly available because
                an actual target is used.</strong></li>
        <li>Lab 10: Technical Risk Analysis, Short to Medium.</li>
        <li>Lab 11: Android Malware Analysis, Short to Medium</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Q: Does this course count towards the M.S. in Cybersecurity and Public Policy?</h3>
    <p>A: Yes</p>
    <h3>Q: Does this course count towards the M.S. in Software Systems Development?</h3>
    <p>A: Yes. In fact, this is one of the four required courses for the M.S.</p>
    <h3>Q: Why is using a Kali virtual machine not mandatory for this class and thus strongly recommended?</h3>
    <p>A: The reasons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Accessibility. For students who are visually impaired, using a virtual machine can be very difficult.
        </li>
        <li>Not all students have a capable laptop. Sometimes due to financial reasons, some students use
            Chromebooks.
            The tools required for this course can be installed natively on macOS, Windows, and Linux.</li>
        <li>Performance. Sometimes, using a VM can be very slow. A VM also do not use native drivers (e.g., for
            networking).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Q: Is Piazza used in this course?</h3>
    <p>In summer 2020, I will use Piazza again. In spring 2020, I decided not to use Piazza because (1) I felt it was a
        nuisance for students to use multiple websites and services for one course, and (2) at times, it was
        underutilized. However, I noticed a drop-off in the discussions, and the Discussions interface on Canvas isn't
        as nice as Piazza's. Also, students can chime in anonymously on Piazza but not on Canvas. Finally, because most
        Computer Science courses use Piazza, it has been an expectation for students. Thus, I'm bringing it back.</p>
    <h3>Q: Why is there a course website and a course Canvas? If you say "it is a nuisance for students to use
        multiple
        websites and services for one course", what gives?</h3>
    <p>This course website serves a few critical purposes. Years ago, I made a decision to make all the readings,
        slide
        decks, and most of the labs publicly available. The reasons: (1) to show that Tufts is serious and is
        working on
        Cyber Security matters, (2) to provide learning material to the public on Cyber Security as the Cyber
        Security
        education problem is very dire, (3) for recordkeeping on what is taught and not taught in this Security
        class --this comes up often when we speak to industry and organizations who want to work with Tufts on Cyber
        Security-related matters. The Canvas site for this course isn't made publicly available. Even if Canvas site
        was
        made publicly available, content is behind a walled garden, and (4) for redundancy if Canvas goes down.</p>
    <h3>Q: I have not taken a course on Networks (COMP 112), Operating Systems (COMP 111), or Computer Architecture
        (COMP 40) yet. Is that a problem?</h3>
    <p>No. Cyber Security is a very broad field and it is impossible for anyone, even professionals, to know
        everything.
        What is important for you is to start thinking about Security.</p>
    <h3>Q: If I am taking this course for professional purpose, can I have a tuition reimbursement letter or
        certificate?</h3>
    <p>A: <a href="https://twitter.com/0xmchow/status/1085649884663828481" target="_blank">Absolutely! It's a nice
            tuition reimbursement letter, hand signed!</a></p>
    <h3>Q: Is there an archive of a previous course website available?</h3>
    <p>A: Sure, <a href="index-spring2020.html">here is the public course website for spring 2020 semester</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="policy">Course Policies</h2>
    <h3>Labs</h3>
    <p>All labs for a given topic are due on the Wednesday of the next topic at 11:59 PDT. Late labs are not
        accepted.</p>

    <h2 id="expectations">Expectations and Structure of This Online Course</h2>
    <p>This course will be a fun one for sure. A few notes on the expectations and structure of this course:</p>

    <h3>1. What this course will NOT have and what I will NOT do:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Have set office hours.</li>
        <li>Have synchronous lectures and long video recordings of lectures.</li>
        <li>Require students to meet online during specific times.</li>
        <li>Require students to work in teams, a semester group project.</li>
        <li>Require students to physical meet at the Tufts Medford Campus.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are many good reasons why I will not do any of the above items:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's summertime. Many of you have commitments and plans already scheduled.</li>
        <li>A number of you are working (full-time or internship). That's more important as people need to live, eat.
        </li>
        <li>Some students are taking this course abroad. Thus, there are time zone differences.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Adding constraints and extra burden to your lives especially during the summer will not fit well with anyone.
        Extra constraints and burden also defeat the purpose of an online course. Thus, you will probably not see me at
        all this summer.</p>

    <h3>2. You are on your own pace.</h3>
    <p>You can choose to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pace yourself during the week</li>
        <li>Do everything during the weekend</li>
        <li>Do everything during the last minute</li>
        <li>Don't do any of the work</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Your choice, but the latter three choices are not wise.</p>

    <h3>3. You are responsible for your own learning.</h3>
    <p>A very important point: if you want everything gone over in lecture or in notes, then this is not the course for
        you. More importantly, that's not how things work in real life.</p>

    <h3>4. You will learn by doing.</h3>
    <p>Each week, there will be at most three labs to hone your skills and to aim at the
        crux of the matter for the week. Here's an analogy: you don't learn how to cook simply by just reading cookbooks
        and watching YouTube videos. You learn by making, using your hands, and making mistakes.</p>

    <h3>5. You will learn by asking questions.</h3>
    <p>It is your responsibility to ask questions early and to ask for help...</p>

    <h3>6. ...and I expect discussions online to be very active and civil.</h3>
    <p>Share thoughts and respond to other people's questions. I will be online constantly, thus the idea of set office
        hours almost becomes moot point. It is no secret that I respond very quickly unless I need to be away.</p>
